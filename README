This is my attempt at reverse engineering libblanket.so from the Kindle Touch.
LibBlanket is used on the Kindle to draw graphics natively using Cairo. There
are various Blanket modules on the system that handle events. For example, one
module shows the USB connection screen, another one shows the language picker
screen, and two modules handle the screensaver (ad and non-ad). In order to
better understand the Blanket system, I have re-implemented the screensaver
(non-ad) module in C and reversed the API calls to libBlanket. My screensaver
module should compile to very similar machine code as Amazon's original, and
the header file I wrote for Blanket should be fairly accurate. Unknown function
arguments are un-named, and the named arguments should be clear as of their
purpose.

To compile, you must have the following packages:
libcairo2-dev
libglib2.0-dev
libpango1.0-dev
libx11-dev

2025 update:
libblanket has changed since this was originally reverse engineered, and the
original screensaver module has gained additional functionality as well (e.g.
several possible renderings of book covers).

This repo has a working version of @yifanlu's reversed version -- it does not
yet support the book cover rendering or custom screensavers from userstorage.
